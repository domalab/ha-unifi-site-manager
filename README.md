| refresh_type | string | "all" | Type of data to refresh: "all", "sites", "hosts", or "metrics" |

## API Rate Limiting

The UniFi Site Manager API has a rate limit of 100 requests per minute. The integration handles this automatically by:

- Tracking remaining API calls
- Implementing backoff when limits are reached
- Efficiently batching requests where possible

## Troubleshooting

1. **Integration Not Updating**: Check your API key permissions and network connectivity
2. **API Rate Limits**: Increase update intervals if you're managing many sites
3. **Missing Data**: Verify your UniFi account has access to the expected sites
4. **Authentication Errors**: Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions
